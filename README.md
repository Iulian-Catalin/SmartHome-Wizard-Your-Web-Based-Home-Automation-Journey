Desciption: "SmartHome Wizard: Your Web-Based Home Automation Journey" is a sophisticated home automation solution, designed to offer intuitive and efficient control of electrical devices at home via a responsive web application. Developed using Java 17 and integrated with a robust PostgreSQL database, the application facilitates detailed management of electrical appliances in various rooms, through a user-friendly and secure interface.

Key features include a secure login page, a user registration system that enforces email format validation and acceptance of terms and conditions, with the option to subscribe to a newsletter. At the heart of the application, the management page allows users to add and configure electrical devices in any room, adjust settings, and monitor energy consumption in watts, providing instant feedback on total kWh consumption. An innovative feature is the implementation of a 10-second TIMER, which automatically controls the activation and deactivation of devices, calculating energy consumption in real-time for each device, before giving the user the option to log out and return to the login page.

This application exemplifies the advanced application of modern web technologies, including Java 17, Maven, Tomcat, and a full web development stack (Web servlets, Jakarta, Json, HTML5, Javascript, CSS3, JQuery, Ajax), demonstrating my ability to build complex web solutions and tackle technical challenges with creative and effective solutions.
